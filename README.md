# Object Detection using YOLOv8.
Implemented using streamlit framework and "yolov8n".

Prerequisits- <br>
    1.streamlit      <br>
    2.python3        <br>
    3.ultralytics    <br>

Install the dependencies using <br>
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<br>
Change the code on line 160 to load appropriate model as per your need, human_* are custom trained moodels to detect human precisely.You may download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-rjnbsLSosu_dzjj7fFCrm0VO9DkJqom?usp=sharing).
